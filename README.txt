This is a little text adventure RPG type game that will hopefully be quite easily extensible to create other games with almost identical code. The idea is that it will write out an epic poem type thing that details the player character's exploits. It's kinda like the journal in some CRPGs but cooler.

---------------------------------------------
Planned features:
	game save and load
	read all story, characters, locations, etc from files so that all that really needs to be done to make a different game is change that and a little bit of logic
